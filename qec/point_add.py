        One p is enough because the window is all ones under a pending p at every subtract,
        which comes after the tick's crossing bits have met p. This holds along a run from the
        borrow that set p, not for an arbitrary p. A borrow leaves
        the window only when it is 0, and leaves it all ones over a low zone 2^kappa - d with
        d <= u + 2. Then v >= 3 * 2^kappa, so u < 2^kappa / 9 by the tick's potential bound, the
        low zone stays above u, and no subtract borrows from the window; each shift halves d,
        each subtract takes it to (d + u) / 2, and a bit that comes to the window's top under p
        is a 1 or clears p. The run starts where the word first has LAZY_WINDOW + 1 bits, after
        a drop at the same width, so the one bit above the window is new and V's is 0. It ends
        at that length before a narrower tick with the same threshold, where the last tick clears
        the counter and V's extra wire and leaves p's wire as junk; the plan is left alone
        otherwise."""
