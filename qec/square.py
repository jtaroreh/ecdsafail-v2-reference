"""Y^2 mod q on a fold of 2^n = f, for q = 2^n - f with f*f <= q.

Write ~Y = 2^n - 1 - Y. Each pair i < j gives y_i*~y_j + y_j*~y_i = y_i ^ y_j, and the
diagonal gives 0, so Y*~Y = sum over i < j of (y_i ^ y_j)*2^(i + j), a sum of rows with no
control on any of them. Q = Y + Y*~Y = Y*(2^n - Y), so Y^2 = 2^n*(Y - hi) - lo for
Q = lo + 2^n*hi, and Y - hi = D is at least 0. The rest folds 2^n to f:

    Z = (2^n - lo) + f*D = lo1 + 2^n*E, E <= f
    V = lo1 + f*E, V = Y^2 + f mod q, 0 <= V - f, V < 2^n + f*f

If V >= 2^n, dropping that bit subtracts q and f together and leaves V - 2^n <= f*f - 1 < q.
Otherwise V - f < q, so subtracting f is enough. So no comparison with q is needed.
